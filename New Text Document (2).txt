Astrophysics and cosmology are rich with data. The advent of wide-area
digital cameras on large aperture telescopes has led to ever more ambitious
surveys of the sky. Data volumes of entire surveys a decade ago can now be
acquired in a single night and real-time analysis is often desired. Thus, modern
astronomy requires big data know-how, in particular it demands highly
efficient machine learning and image analysis algorithms. But scalability
is not the only challenge: Astronomy applications touch several current machine
learning research questions, such as learning from biased data and dealing
with label and measurement noise. We argue that this makes astronomy
a great domain for computer science research, as it pushes the boundaries of
data analysis. In the following, we will present this exciting application area
for data scientists. We will focus on exemplary results, discuss main challenges,
and highlight some recent methodological advancements in machine
learning and image analysis triggered by astronomical applications.

    I think that astrophysics and cosmology are very important subjects for our life.
    These sciences push the boundaries of human knowledge.
